## About Me

Welcome! I am a Data Engineer applying big data tools and quantum computing to finance and advanced data manipulation in Blueshift Brazil.

Originally from Americana, Sao Paulo, I studied Biological Science at the Pontifical Catholic University of Campinas, and I was a research scholarship at Universidade Federal do ABC with a computational neuroscience project in partnership with IBM Brazil. Also, I am the founder of NanoX, a project for progress of advanced atomically precise manufacturing AI-driven.

Passionate about plethora of topics, I am also a psychoanalyst (in training), and an avid reader in philosophy, economy, history, and literature. I advocate global impact solutions for green-technologies, life-extension, space mining, brain preservation, poverty reduction strategies, women's and minority empowerment, and moral and cognitive enhancement.

## Skills

- **Big data:** Data Manipulation, ETL/ELT, Data Factory, Spark/Pypark, 
- **Analytics:** Business Inteligence, Services Analysis, DAX
- **Languages:** Python, SQL, R
- **Quantum Computing:** Azure Quantum, Quantum Data Encoding 

## Research & Projects

- **Computational Neuroscience** 

My research project was funded by Braziliam CNPQ and Fapesp in partnership with IBM Lab and Iran in the Cognitive Computing axis. 
Our research investigated the role of mirror neurons, using computer modeling with altered ion channels in autism and also in language processing.

- **Moral Enhancement** 

I believe in progressive human enhancement from a humanistic, liberal, inclusive and realistic point of view, through new technologies and scientifically informed strategies. That's why I'm working on a roadmap about advanced neurotechnologies and nanotechnologies for moral and cognitive enhancement, in principle in the forensic context.

- **Atomically Precise Manufacturing** 

I founded Nano X in Brazil to advance the long-term progress of science and technology towards atomically precise manufacturing, which is the future version of molecular nanotechnology enabled for industrial production with radical abundance, as envisioned by Feynmann and Drexler. I believe AI can drive nanoscale fabrication and molecular robotic assembly.
